# clinicalsignificance (development version)

# clinicalsignificance 2.1.0
- I included the JSS article <doi:10.18637/jss.v111.i01> as a reference.

# clinicalsignificance 2.0.0

## Breaking changes

-   The former main function `clinical_significance()` is deprecated. The package now offers several different approaches to clinical significance analyses, namely:
    -   `cs_anchor()` (Anchor-based approaches)
    -   `cs_percentage()`(Percentage-change approaches)
    -   `cs_distribution()`(Distribution-based approaches)
    -   `cs_statistical()`(Statistical approaches)
    -   `cs_combined()`(Combined approaches)

The function `clinical_significance()` used the combined approach (distribution-based and statistical). So the identical analysis can be carried out with `cs_combined()`.

-  The function `check_cutoff()` is deprecated.

-   When `method = "HLM`, participants with three or more data points will be used. Before, participants with at least three data points (i.e., 4 or more) were used.


## New features

-   You can now specify a significance level at which you want the analysis to be based on with the `significance_level` argument. The default is `significance_level = 0.05`. Note that for this is the Phi max level when you set `method = "HA"` as outlined in their article.

-   The package now offers to combined approaches: The classic combination of statistical and distribution-based approaches but also the combination of statistical and anchor-based approaches

-  We included the function `cs_get_model()` to retrieve the hierarchical linear model that is fit during the distribution-based approach if the HLM method is requested.

- The `hechler_2014` dataset was included to ensure reproducibility of the JSS article.


## Minor improvements and fixes

-   Change the whole package to use R's native pipe operator `|>`
-   Remove unnecessary dependency on `magrittr`
-   Include new vignettes replacing the old ones
-   Display correct percentages in summary tables
-   Update package vignettes

# clinicalsignificance 1.2.1

## Breaking changes

-   Remove default theming from `check_cutoff()` as in other plot functions


## Minor improvements and fixes

-   Improve documentation of datasets
-   Include examples for `summary()` and `plot()` method

# clinicalsignificance 1.2.0

## Breaking changes

-   Remove default theming from `plot()` to give the user more control over the overall appearance

## Minor improvements and fixes

-   Further implementation of tidyeval principles since `aes_()` was deprecated
-   Small improvements in vignettes
-   Better documentation for some functions

# clinicalsignificance 1.1.0

-   Fix HLM method empirical bayes estimation (#2). This now relies on the lme4 package
-   Consider the instrument direction for group level summaries in the HA method (#1) which was not done in the initial release

# clinicalsignificance 1.0.1

-   Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
-   Added package URLs to DESCRIPTION, including one for bug reports
-   New package logo
